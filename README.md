# Wannaroo Rails

NewGRF for OpenTTD - Default railtypes with a few extras.

1. About

    The default railtypes, enhanced with customisable costs, speed limits, signals. Trains can run on their usual railtype as well as later railtypes. (RAIL engines/wagons can run on RAIL, ELRL, MONO, MGLV; ELRL => ELRL, MONO, MGLV, etc.)

1. Compatibility

    Wannaroo Rails should be compatible with other newgrfs, but the usual caveats apply:

    May or may not play nicely with other track sets. YMMV.

    Compatibility with any newgrf is not guaranteed. No warranties are expressed or implied.

    Requirements: OpenTTD 1.9.0 or later.

1. Features

    * Customisable costs, speed limits.

    * Default semaphore signals can be replaced with either Termite Metro or NUTS signals.

    * Engines/wagons can run on their usual railtype, as well as any later railtype.

    * Narrow gauge support for Iron Horse and North Korean Trains Set.

1. Development

    A single, simple nml file.

    I built this newgrf on Linux Mint 19.3 using NML version 0.5.2.

    Translations gladly accepted. Please open an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/jrook1445/wannaroo-rails) and attach your lang file so I can include it in a release.
