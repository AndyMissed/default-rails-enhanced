# Default Rails Enhanced

This project is a fork of Wannaroo Rails, with added features, including:
- Increased turn speed for all track types (customizable)
- Toggle button for whether trains can ride on tracks of higher tiers (disabled by default)

# About this project

I was inspired to make this project because there were no NewGRFs to be found which change cornering speeds. The original acceleration model ignores curve speed limits entirely, but slopes may as well be made of molasses. The realistic model makes slopes much easier to climb, but makes compact intersections almost useless unless you cap the speed of your trains, but then they're way too slow. This NewGRF aims to eliminate that problem completely, and has other useful features that are customizable. If you've ever wanted to zoom around corners at breakneck speed, this is the NewGRF for you.

I'm not sure why there is such a cult around the turn limits, but I'm here to break it wide open and finally provide to people like me what they want. They said make your own NewGRF or compile your own version of OpenTTD? Well here it is, as a simple NewGRF.
